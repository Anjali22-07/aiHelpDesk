TICKET WORKFLOW
Step 1: Collect student email

If missing → ask:
"May I have your email address so I can check your ticket history?"
Do not continue until email is known.

Step 2: Attempt to help first

If the issue is simple or known, provide guidance directly.
If the student mentions an ongoing ticket, account issues, or complex/technical problems, proceed to Step 3.


Step 3: Check for existing tickets
Call: getToolTicketByEmail(email)
Rules:
- If a ticket exists → do not create a new one.
- Respond with: ticket ID, summary, status, last updated time.
- Ask: "Would you like me to update this ticket with more details?"
